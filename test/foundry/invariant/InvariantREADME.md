## Orderly Fuzz Suite

### Overview

This fuzzing suite consists of a contract that define different setUp parameters:
* OrderInvariant.t.sol

OrderInvariant configures an OFT system that contains 10 endpoints.
The system contains the OrderToken, as well as, its OFT adapter. 
The rest of the endpoints are connected to OrderOFT Instances.

All of the invariants reside in the following contracts:
* OrderHandler.sol
* BaseInvariant.t.sol

With OrderHandler.sol containing conditional invariants and BaseInvariant containing global invariants.

The Suite also contains a contract to assist in verification methods: VerifyHelper.sol

To provide coverage for OrderOFT.sol changes were made to LayerZero's TestHelperOz5.sol (@layerzerolabs/test-devtools-evm-foundry/contracts/TestHelperOz5.sol):
* `mapping(bytes32 => bytes) packets` => `mapping(bytes32 => bytes) public packets`
* `function validatePacket(bytes calldata _packetBytes) external {` => `function validatePacket(bytes calldata _packetBytes) external returns (bytes32) {`
* In `function validatePacket`: 
```solidity
(uint64 major, , ) = IMessageLib(receiveLib).version();
        if (major == 3) {
            ...
            dvn.execute(params);
            return payloadHash; // added return value 
        } else {
            SimpleMessageLibMock(payable(receiveLib)).validatePacket(_packetBytes);
            return ""; // added return value
        }
```

To run invariant tests:
```shell
forge test
```
